# Interesting-Codes

### Collection of some of the interesting coding questions I came across and their solutions

 1. **Case**: consider a string encoding such that each alphabet character is mapped
    to a number between 1 and 26
     - _ex: A = 1, J = 10, Y = 25, Z = 26_
     - _so: ABC = 123, XYZ = 242526_

    **Problem Statement**: Given a encoded string print all the possible decodings associated
     - _ex: 123 can be 1 2 3 = ABC or 1 23 = AW or 12 3 = LC_

    **Note**: This solution was coded on C++ compiler below C++11 hence there are some
    redundant code blocks
